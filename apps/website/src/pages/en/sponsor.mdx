## How to sponsor

You can support Papra by sponsoring us on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/papra-hq) or [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/papra).
Even a small contribution is greatly appreciated.

## Why sponsor?

Papra is a free and open-source project built and maintained by a solo developer. Your sponsorship allows me to dedicate more time and resources to improving Papra, adding new features, and providing better support, while ensuring sustainability in the long run.

Your contribution helps keep Papra independent, free from investor pressure, and focused on what matters: building a tool that respects your data and privacy. By sponsoring, you are not only supporting the development of Papra but also contributing to the open-source ecosystem as a whole.

## Benefits of sponsoring

Sponsors can receive recognition on the website and README. If you are a company, we can also discuss dedicated support, or any partnership that benefits both parties.

Do not hesitate to [reach out](/contact) if you have any questions or want to discuss sponsorship opportunities.
