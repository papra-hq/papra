Docker Compose makes it easy to deploy Papra on your server or local machine. Follow these simple steps to get your instance up and running quickly.

<Steps>

1. Prepare your environment

    Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

    Verify your installation:

    ```bash frame="none"
    docker --version
    ```

2. Create Docker Compose file

    Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    services:
      papra:
        image: corentinth/papra:latest-rootless
        ports:
          - '1221:1221'
        volumes:
          - papra-data:/app/app-data
        restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:
      papra-data:
        driver: local
    ```

3. Start Papra

    From the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file, run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    This command downloads the latest Papra image, sets up the container, and starts the Papra service.

4. Access Papra

    Once your container is running, access Papra via your browser at:

    ```
    http://localhost:1221
    ```

    Your Papra instance is now ready for use!

5. To go further

    Check the [configuration](/self-hosting/configuration) page for more information on how to configure your Papra instance.

</Steps>

## Maintenance

Check logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Stop the service

```bash
docker compose down
```

Update Papra

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

You're all set! Enjoy managing your documents with Papra.
