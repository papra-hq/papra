Papra supports advanced search queries with **filters**, **logical operators**, and **grouping** to help you find documents efficiently.

## Basic full text search

A simple search query like `foobar` will search across both document names and content:

```yaml
# Search documents where name or content contains
foobar

# This is equivalent to
name:foobar OR content:foobar
```

Full text search can be combined with filters for more precise results.

```yaml
# Search documents with tag invoice and containing foobar
tag:invoices foobar
```

## Filters

Use filters to search specific document properties. Current supported filters:

- `name:` - Search in document names
- `content:` - Search in document content
- `tag:` - Search by tag name or ID

### Filter Examples

```yaml
name:invoice
```

Finds documents whose name contains "invoice"

```yaml
content:"financial report"
```

Finds documents with "financial report" in their content (use quotes for phrases with spaces)

```yaml
tag:urgent
```

Finds documents tagged with "urgent"

:::note
The `name:` and `content:` filters use **contains** matching, not exact equality. So `name:foo` will match documents named "foo", "foobar", "my-foo-document", etc.
:::

## Logical Operators

Combine filters using logical operators (case-insensitive):

- `AND` - Both conditions must match
- `OR` - Either condition must match
- `NOT` (or `-`) - Negates the condition

### Operator Examples

```yaml
name:invoice AND tag:paid
```

Finds invoices that are tagged as paid

```yaml
content:contract OR content:agreement
```

Finds documents containing "contract" or "agreement"

```yaml
tag:important NOT tag:archived
```

Finds important documents that are not archived

:::tip
Multiple filters without an explicit operator are joined with `AND` by default:

```yaml
name:report tag:2024
```

This is equivalent to: `name:report AND tag:2024`
:::

## Negation

Negate filters using either `-` prefix or `NOT` operator:

```yaml
# Both equivalent
-tag:archived
NOT tag:archived
```

Both find documents that are not tagged with "archived"

## Grouping

Use parentheses `(...)` to group expressions and control precedence:

```yaml
(name:invoice OR name:receipt) AND tag:2024
```

Finds documents from 2024 that are either invoices or receipts

```yaml
tag:important AND (tag:client-a OR tag:client-b)
```

Finds important documents for client-a or client-b

## Quoted Values

Use double quotes to search for phrases with spaces:

```yaml
content:"quarterly financial report"
```

```yaml
name:"Budget 2024"
```

## Implementation Notes

The search functionality is built using:
- Custom parser in the [`@papra/search-parser`](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/tree/main/packages/search-parser) package
- SQLite FTS5 (Full-Text Search) for efficient text matching
- Support for additional filters coming in future updates
