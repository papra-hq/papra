Papra supports advanced search queries with **filters**, **logical operators**, and **grouping** to help you find documents efficiently.

## Basic full text search

A simple search query like `foobar` will search across both document names and content:

```yaml
# Search documents where name or content contains
foobar

# This is equivalent to
name:foobar OR content:foobar
```

Full text search can be combined with filters for more precise results.

```yaml
# Search documents with tag invoice and containing foobar
tag:invoices foobar
```

## Filters

Use filters to search specific document properties. Current supported filters:

- `name:` - Search in document names
- `content:` - Search in document content
- `tag:` - Search by tag name or ID
- `created:` - Filter by document creation date
- `has:tags` - Check if documents have any tags, it can be negated with `-has:tags` or `NOT has:tags` to find untagged documents

### Filter Examples

```yaml
# Finds documents whose name contains "invoice"
name:invoice

# Finds documents with "financial report" in their content
# use quotes for phrases with spaces
content:"financial report"

# Finds documents tagged with "urgent"
tag:urgent

# Finds documents created after January 1st, 2024
created:>2024

# Finds documents that have at least one tag
has:tags

# Finds documents without any tags
-has:tags
```


:::note
The `name:` and `content:` filters use **contains** matching, not exact equality. So `name:foo` will match documents named "foo", "foobar", "my-foo-document", etc.
:::

### Existence Filter

The `has:` filter checks whether documents have certain properties:

- `has:tags` - Documents with at least one tag
- `-has:tags` or `NOT has:tags` - Documents without any tags

#### Existence Filter Examples

```yaml
# Find all untagged documents
-has:tags

# Find tagged invoices
has:tags invoice

# Find untagged documents from 2024
-has:tags created:>=2024

# Find tagged documents that are not archived
has:tags NOT tag:archived
```

### Date Filter

The `created:` filter supports date comparisons with the following operators:

- `=` - Exact date match
- `>` - After the date
- `>=` - On or after the date
- `<` - Before the date
- `<=` - On or before the date

#### Date Format

Dates can be specified in various formats, including:

- Only year: `YYYY` (interpreted as January 1st of that year)
- Month and year: `YYYY-MM` (interpreted as the first day of that month)
- Common formats: `YYYY/MM/DD`, `YYYY.MM.DD`, `Month DD, YYYY`, etc.
- ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`, etc.

Invalid date formats will be ignored in the search query.

#### Date Filter Examples

```yaml
# Finds documents created exactly on January 15th, 2024 at 00:00:00
created:2024-01-15

# Finds documents created after January 1st, 2024
created:>2024

# Finds documents created on or after January 1st, 2024
created:>=2024-01-01

# Finds documents created before December 31st, 2024
created:<2024-12-31

# Finds documents created on or before June 30th, 2024
created:<=2024-06-30

# Finds invoices created only in 2024
tag:invoice created:>2024 created:<2025
```


## Logical Operators

Combine filters using logical operators (case-insensitive):

- `AND` - Both conditions must match
- `OR` - Either condition must match
- `NOT` (or `-`) - Negates the condition

### Operator Examples

```yaml
name:invoice AND tag:paid
```

Finds invoices that are tagged as paid

```yaml
content:contract OR content:agreement
```

Finds documents containing "contract" or "agreement"

```yaml
tag:important NOT tag:archived
```

Finds important documents that are not archived

:::tip
Multiple filters without an explicit operator are joined with `AND` by default:

```yaml
name:report tag:2024
```

This is equivalent to: `name:report AND tag:2024`
:::

## Negation

Negate filters using either `-` prefix or `NOT` operator:

```yaml
# Both equivalent
-tag:archived
NOT tag:archived
```

Both find documents that are not tagged with "archived"

## Grouping

Use parentheses `(...)` to group expressions and control precedence:

```yaml
(name:invoice OR name:receipt) AND tag:2024
```

Finds documents from 2024 that are either invoices or receipts

```yaml
tag:important AND (tag:client-a OR tag:client-b)
```

Finds important documents for client-a or client-b

## Quoted Values

Use double quotes to search for phrases with spaces:

```yaml
content:"quarterly financial report"
```

```yaml
name:"Budget 2024"
```

## Implementation Notes

The search functionality is built using:
- Custom parser in the [`@papra/search-parser`](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/tree/main/packages/search-parser) package
- SQLite FTS5 (Full-Text Search) for efficient text matching
- Support for additional filters coming in future updates
